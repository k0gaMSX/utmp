current tty. It is designed for helping in some terminal emulators
or session manager which lack support for it.

-------

There are three different interfaces to utmp; SystemV, BSD and POSIX.
SystemV and POSIX are basically the same interface (POSIX has
better definitons for utmp fields, like for example ut_pid which
in some system was a short instead of a pid_t), but BSD is very
different. utmp has implemented the three interfaces, and
it supplies three different config files, so the user only has
to rename the proper one to config.mk. It is also added a
basic configure, which selects POSIX interface for all plataforms
except for OpenBSD.

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install
